# Browser Extension Demo Project (SWH GSoC2022)
Here a simple demo project showing my capability to work on this browser extension project. Please note the things that are working are:
1. An icon for extension.
2. Github repository finding in software heritage archives using APIs.

## How to test?
Easy, quickly download this repository and go to Chrome Settings -> Extensions and then click on Load Unpacked and select your downloaded folder. It will import the extension and to finally test it, Just go to any github repository, It will give alertbox telling if repository is avaliable in archives of SwH.
